# BlogOpinion Backend

## Objective
Build a backend for a blog service with basic functionality, focusing on user management and blog operations.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication
- User signup, login, and logout.

- Fetch all blogs or a specific blog by ID.
- Update existing blogs.
- Delete blogs.

### User Interaction (Optional for Future)
- Likes and comments for blogs.

## Non-functional Requirements
- **Security**: Protect user data with hashing (e.g., bcrypt). *(Optional)*
- **Scalability**: Design APIs to handle future growth in traffic and features.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries for fast response times.

---

## Constraints
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- **Deployment**: Local or cloud-based services like AWS or Heroku.
- **Timeline**: Complete basic functionality within a defined sprint.

---

## Deliverables
- REST APIs for user and blog management.
- Database schema for users and blogs.
- API documentation for developers (e.g., Swagger or Postman collection).
